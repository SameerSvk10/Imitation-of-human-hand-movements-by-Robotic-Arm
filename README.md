# Imitation-of-human-hand-movements-by-Robotic-Arm
It is a Robotic arm which imitates human hand movement in 2 dimensional space. Frames are captured through camera and they are processed to find angles between the joints using Image processing techniques. Calculated angles are given to the servo motors attached to the Arm to imitate our hand movement.
You can find the explanation in 'RoboticArm.pdf' file.
I have also included comments in python and arduino codes.
